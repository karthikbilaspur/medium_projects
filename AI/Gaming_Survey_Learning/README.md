Code Components:
Gaming Environment (gaming_environment.py)
Defines a custom gaming environment class (GamingEnvironment)
Initializes environment with survey data (data)
Defines state space, action space, and reward range
Implements reset, step, and calculate_reward methods
Q-Learning Agent (q_learning_agent.py)
Defines a Q-learning agent class (QLearningAgent)
Initializes agent with environment (env) and hyperparameters
Implements get_action and update_q_table methods
Training (train.py)
Trains Q-learning agent using train_agent function
Returns reward history and Q-table data
Testing (test.py)
Tests trained Q-learning agent using test_agent function
Returns reward history
Visualization (visualize_learning.py)
Visualizes reward history and Q-table values using Matplotlib
Main (main.py)
Loads survey data and creates gaming environment
Creates and trains Q-learning agent
Tests trained agent and visualizes results
Key Features:
Reinforcement Learning: Q-learning algorithm for decision-making
Custom Environment: Gaming environment based on survey data
Modular Code: Separate files for environment, agent, training, testing, and visualization
Visualization: Matplotlib-based visualization of reward history and Q-table values
Libraries and Tools:
Python: Programming language
NumPy: Numerical computations
Pandas: Data manipulation
Gym: Reinforcement learning environments
Matplotlib: Data visualization
Data:
